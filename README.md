Project Overview
The Sorting Visualizer provides an interactive visualization of different sorting algorithms. Users can select an algorithm, generate a random array, and control the speed of the sorting process using a slider. This is a great educational tool for understanding how various sorting techniques manipulate data to sort it.

Features
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Visualizes popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.
Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of the sorting visualization using a slider (range from 50ms to 2000ms).
Random Array Generation: A new random array can be generated at any time with a button click.
Real-time Visualization: Step-by-step animations of how each sorting algorithm operates.
Dark Mode Design: The web page features a modern dark theme for better visual appeal.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the page.
CSS: For styling the page, including the dark mode theme.
JavaScript: For dynamically generating the array and implementing the sorting algorithms.
