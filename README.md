## Project Overview

The Sorting Visualizer provides an interactive visualization of different sorting algorithms. Users can select an algorithm, generate a random array, and control the speed of the sorting process using a slider. This is a great educational tool for understanding how various sorting techniques manipulate data to sort it.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualizes popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort.
- **Speed Control**: Users can adjust the speed of the sorting visualization using a slider (range from 50ms to 2000ms).
- **Random Array Generation**: A new random array can be generated at any time with a button click.
- **Real-time Visualization**: Step-by-step animations of how each sorting algorithm operates.
- **Dark Mode Design**: The web page features a modern dark theme for better visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page, including the dark mode theme.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamically generating the array and implementing the sorting algorithms.

## Installation and Setup

To run the Sorting Visualizer locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd sorting-visualizer
    ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**:
   You can simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser by double-clicking it or opening it through a code editor.

   Alternatively, you can run a local web server to serve the files:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
